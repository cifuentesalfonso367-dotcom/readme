On this website, we can find different sections such as:
The homepage, where we use various features like a gallery, containers, buttons, and two images. On one side, we have buttons for home, registration, testimonials, services, features, and login, all in our header.
Further down, in the center, we have descriptive text in two colors, black and green, as well as a descriptive image about the page. Below that, we have a small gallery where we've placed our featured clients and some of their logos.

A little further down, we have boxes with representative images of some services and their respective descriptions (to do this, we used functions like flex, div, button class, and img for image insertion). We've also divided this into different sections. Further down, we insert another image (using the "insert from the assets folder" method), along with a short text and a green "see more" button (which is centered and has the green code added without any borders or additional decorations). Following this, we add another text box in two colors, providing a brief description. To its right, we have another logo box, divided into four logos accompanied by numbers and letters (for this, we again use the galery property, inserting our logos "by inserting images from the assets folder" and spacing them, as well as adding accompanying text and numbers).

Here again, we add an image using the insertion method (img plus the link from the assets folder), as well as centered text on the right containing a title, and below that, body text with spacing for visual improvement. Further down, we also have another image inserted (using the same method, bringing it from assets), along with two-color text, a long body text in black, and finally, a name in green. This is accompanied by another gallery where we'll find company logos or icons, and to their right, green text with a green arrow pointing to the right.

Below this, we have several images, each containing a text box in the middle (these are extracted from Figma and placed in the assets folder where we'll use them later, and each is positioned using the flex function so that it occupies its corresponding place). Finally, in the folder section, we find a series of elements, including the company logo on a dark blue background. There are also columns of information such as the company's legal information, support details, and other options. (This was achieved by importing the logos from the `assent` folder and using the `flex` function to position each one. The text was then added in columns with spacing between them.)
